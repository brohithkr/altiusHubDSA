## 1. Design a RESTful CRUD API

-   Task: Build a RESTful API to manage a collection of books

-   Requirements:

	- Implement endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

	- Use appropriate HTTP methods and status codes.
  
	- Integrate with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
  
	- Handle error cases gracefully.

-  Evaluation Criteria:

	-  Adherence to REST principles.

	-  Code organization and modularity.

	-  Error handling and input validation.

	-  Use of ORM or database abstraction layers.

2. Implement Authentication and Authorization

-   Task: Add user authentication to an existing API.

-  Requirements:

	- Implement user registration and login functionality.

	-  Use JWT or session-based authentication.

	-  Protect certain endpoints to be accessible only by authenticated users.

	- Implement role-based access control for specific resources.

-  Evaluation Criteria:

    -  Security best practices (e.g., password hashing, token expiration).

    -  Proper middleware usage for protecting routes.

    -  Scalability considerations
